William and Beza, Networked Justice


There are numerous means that voting can be suppressed; this website concept’s aim would be to educate on the primary means of voter suppression through emphasizing the simplicity and trivializing these infringements on our democracy. Whether it’s fake ballot boxes, racial and political gerrymandering, stricter voter ID laws, sabotaging booths, limiting number of booths, etc. It would be an interactive website where you take the perspective of the saboteur.
