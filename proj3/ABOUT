There are numerous means that voting can be suppressed; this website concept’s aim would be to educate on the primary means of voter suppression through emphasizing the simplicity and trivializing these infringements on our democracy. Whether it’s fake ballot boxes, racial and political gerrymandering, stricter voter ID laws, sabotaging booths, limiting number of booths, etc. It would be an interactive website where you take the perspective of the saboteur.Each page of the website has a link to news articles that examine these obstacles to voting so users can be reminded of the severity and the reality of these tactics. This website is for people who are not aware of the extent of these infringements on voting rights and hope that the site acts as a satirical reflection of the hurdles still present in the modern world.
